## mobrix-ui philosophy

This library is built upon few (but important) concepts:

- Small library size, to not impact on final app bundle size
- Few dependencies, to not introduce a bunch of additional packages (that could also introduce bugs or version conflicts with pre-existent packages)
- Let the user customize every part as desired, but with default values set otherwise, to make every component ready to be used without so many parameters
- Every component should be integrable into every react app, so their behaviour must be customizable too (with callbacks, for example)

The same concepts are also the base of another project I maintain, [MoBrix-engine](https://github.com/CianciarusoCataldo/mobrix-engine) (check it out, it is also the base of [MoBrix-ui guide page](https://cianciarusocataldo.github.io/mobrix-ui/) !)

<br>

## Components building process

This library use a standardized process to build every component. As result, every component has a shared initial logic, shared CSS styles and shared properties.

<br>

### Shared components properties

Some properties are shared between all components, for a smoother dev experience. In addition, this makes every single component easily re-usable. Let's see them in details:

| Property    | Description                                                                                                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `className` | custom className applied on main container                                                                         |
| `dark`      | Enable/disable dark mode                                                                                           |
| `hide`      | Hide/show component                                                                                                |
| `id`        | `data-id` parameter (for testing purpose, to easily find the component into the DOM)                               |
| `shadow`    | Enable/disable shadow behind component                                                                             |
| `style`     | [Css inline properties](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_css.asp) applied on main container                     |
| `unstyled`  | If `true`, no standard mobrix-ui styles will be applied on the components (useful for example, with image buttons) |

With these shared properties is possible to drive every component behaviour and UI with an external state management system

<br>

### Customizable UI

MoBrix-ui-components components UI is globally configurable, with CSS variables. By defining some specific custom CSS variables into your app css, you'll change the UI of all components:

| CSS variable                                | Description                                                                                                 | Default value                                 | Related CSS attribute |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `--mobrix-ui-custom-background-dark`        | Components background, when in dark-mode ([dark](#shared-components-properties) is set to true).            | `linear-gradient(to right, #2d3748, #1d232e)` | `background-image`    |
| `--mobrix-ui-custom-background-color-dark`  | Components background color, when in dark-mode ([dark](#shared-components-properties) is set to true).      | `#1d232e`                                     | `background-color`    |
| `--mobrix-ui-custom-text-color-dark`        | Components text color, when in dark-mode ([dark](#shared-components-properties) is set to true).            | `white`                                       | `text-color`          |
| `--mobrix-ui-custom-background-light`       | Components background, when not in dark-mode ([dark](#shared-components-properties) is set to false).       | `linear-gradient(to right, #fff, #eaebec)`    | `background-image`    |
| `--mobrix-ui-custom-background-color-light` | Components background color, when not in dark-mode ([dark](#shared-components-properties) is set to false). | `#f5f5f5`                                     | `background-color`    |
| `--mobrix-ui-custom-text-color-light`       | Components text color, when not in dark-mode ([dark](#shared-components-properties) is set to false).       | `#1b1b1b`                                     | `text-color`          |

If you don't set these variables, the default values will be used.

<br>

### Box components

Some components are designed with a specific structure, to better control and customize their look and feel. This type of components is called `Box Component`, for their particular structure. In addition to the [shared properties](#shared-components-properties), as they are part of MoBrix-ui, they accept 3 additional (and optional) properties:

- `label`, a string or a component rendered above the final component
- `value`, a specific property that drive the component UI, its type vary depends on component itself (for example, for the CheckBox component, it is the check status, as a `boolean` )
- `defaultValue`, the default value to use when `value` is not given or is `undefined`

## Getting started

### Installation

If you want to use this library inside your project, just install it:

```

npm i mobrix-ui

```

### Usage

After installation, you can use every `MoBrix-ui` component in your app. Run this example to see them in action:

```tsx
import { Card, Container, Link } from "mobrix-ui";
import { render } from "react-dom";

render(
  <Container animated>
    <Card
      dark={true}
      body={<p>This page is entirely made with MoBrix-ui components !</p>}
      footer={
        <Link to="https://cianciarusocataldo.github.io/mobrix-ui">
          MoBrix-ui page
        </Link>
      }
    />
  </Container>,
  document.getElementById("root"),
);
```

<br>

If you want to customize the UI globally, initialize the dedicated [CSS variables](#customizable-ui):

```css
* {
  --mobrix-ui-text-color: #f5f5f5;
  --mobrix-ui-background-color: #1b1b1b;
}
```

## Tests

Unit tests for every component are located inside `tests` folder. The test script is executed with pre-defined test command:

    npm run test
